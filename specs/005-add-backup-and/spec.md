# Feature Specification: Database Backup and Clear Settings Page

**Feature Branch**: `005-add-backup-and`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add backup and clear database options. I want to add a new navigation item that will be called settings. In that page I want a button to backup the current database and then I want a button to clear the database which should delete ALL data not related to application settings."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature involves database management operations
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: System administrators
   ’ Actions: Backup database, clear user data, navigate to settings
   ’ Data: Database backup files, vulnerability data, reports
   ’ Constraints: Preserve application settings during clear
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific data constitutes "application settings"?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Where should backup files be stored?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should clear operation require confirmation?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: Navigate to settings, perform backup/clear operations
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement focused on user capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Database backup files, application settings, user data
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding data categorization"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I need to manage the vulnerability database by creating backups for data protection and clearing user data for system maintenance, while preserving essential application settings.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on any page of the vulnerability dashboard, **When** I click the Settings navigation item, **Then** I should be taken to a settings page
2. **Given** I am on the settings page, **When** I click the "Backup Database" button, **Then** the system should create a backup file of the current database
3. **Given** I am on the settings page, **When** I click the "Clear Database" button, **Then** the system should delete all vulnerability data while preserving application settings
4. **Given** I initiate a database clear operation, **When** the operation completes, **Then** I should receive confirmation that data was cleared successfully
5. **Given** I initiate a database backup, **When** the operation completes, **Then** I should receive confirmation with backup file details

### Edge Cases
- What happens when backup storage location is unavailable or full?
- How does system handle clear operation if database is locked or in use?
- What happens if backup operation is interrupted?
- How does system behave if user navigates away during backup/clear operations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a "Settings" navigation item accessible from all pages
- **FR-002**: Settings page MUST display a "Backup Database" button that creates a complete database backup
- **FR-003**: Settings page MUST display a "Clear Database" button that removes all user data
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific application settings during clear operation - what constitutes "application settings"?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide user feedback during backup and clear operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST confirm successful completion of backup and clear operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST store backup files in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: backup storage location not specified]
- **FR-008**: Clear operation MUST require [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirmation mechanism not specified - should this require password, multiple clicks, or other confirmation?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle backup operations without interrupting normal dashboard functionality
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent data corruption during clear operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Database Backup**: Complete snapshot of database at point in time, includes metadata like creation timestamp and file size
- **Application Settings**: Configuration data that persists through clear operations, distinguishes from user-generated vulnerability data
- **User Data**: Vulnerability reports, findings, historical data, and uploaded files that can be safely cleared
