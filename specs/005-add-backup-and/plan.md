# Implementation Plan: Database Backup and Clear Settings Page

**Branch**: `005-add-backup-and` | **Date**: 2025-09-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-add-backup-and/spec.md`

## Summary
Add database management functionality with backup and clear operations accessible through a new Settings page. Implements secure data management while preserving application settings during clear operations. Uses existing Express.js/SQLite architecture with service layer patterns.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js (JavaScript ES6+) with Express.js 4.18.2
**Primary Dependencies**: Express.js, SQLite3, EJS templating, Multer, existing service layer
**Storage**: SQLite database (existing vulnerabilities.db), backup files to filesystem
**Testing**: Jest unit testing, Playwright E2E testing (existing setup)
**Target Platform**: Web application (Node.js server + browser frontend)
**Project Type**: web - Express.js backend with EJS frontend views
**Performance Goals**: Fast backup operations <30s for typical databases, non-blocking UI during operations
**Constraints**: Preserve application settings during clear, secure confirmation for destructive operations
**Scale/Scope**: Single database backup/restore, clear operations for existing vulnerability data tables

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **Services handle business logic**: Will create settingsService.js for backup/clear operations
✅ **Database layer abstracted**: Using existing models/database.js patterns
✅ **Views use EJS templating**: New settings.ejs view with consistent styling
✅ **Static assets served from public/**: CSS/JS assets in public/css and public/js
✅ **Database operations tested**: Will include sample data testing
✅ **Error handling tested**: Edge cases covered for backup/clear failures
✅ **Database queries optimized**: Simple backup/clear operations, no complex queries
✅ **Backward compatibility**: No schema changes, preserves existing vulnerability data structure
✅ **Migration strategy**: No database migrations required
✅ **Security impact**: Secure confirmation mechanisms, proper data validation

**Constitution Compliance**: PASS - Feature follows established patterns

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - matches existing Express.js application structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Phase 0 Complete**: All research tasks completed successfully ✅
- ✅ SQLite backup technology patterns researched
- ✅ Database schema analyzed for application settings vs user data
- ✅ Secure confirmation mechanisms researched
- ✅ Storage location and security patterns defined
- ✅ All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from spec resolved

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved ✅

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete ✅*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - BackupMetadata entity with timestamp, size, reason fields
   - OperationAudit entity for tracking backup/clear operations
   - No schema changes to existing vulnerability tables

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - POST /api/settings/backup - Create database backup
   - POST /api/settings/clear - Clear all user data
   - GET /api/settings/backups - List available backups
   - GET /api/settings/status - Operation status tracking
   - Output OpenAPI schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas including CSRF tokens
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Settings page navigation and display
   - Backup operation workflow with progress tracking
   - Clear operation with type-to-confirm workflow
   - Error handling for backup/clear failures

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude`
   - Add new technology: backup service patterns, CSRF protection
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes

**Phase 1 Complete**: All design artifacts created successfully ✅
- ✅ Data model designed with BackupMetadata, OperationAudit, OperationProgress entities
- ✅ API contracts defined in OpenAPI format with comprehensive endpoints
- ✅ Quickstart guide created with 7 validation scenarios
- ✅ CLAUDE.md agent context updated with new technology stack

**Output**: data-model.md ✅, /contracts/* ✅, quickstart.md ✅, CLAUDE.md ✅

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → service creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Services before routes before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No violations detected - feature aligns with constitutional principles*

No constitutional violations or complexity deviations identified. Feature follows established patterns.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
