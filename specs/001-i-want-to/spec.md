# Feature Specification: Modular Architecture with Tabbed Interface and Settings

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to refactor this app to be more modular. Currently it can import and parse AWS inspector reports. I would consider that module 1 and is the default module. Now I want to add a module for SBOM reports. I would like to update the UI accordingly and essentially create a tab for each module. The modules should be disabled by default except the current module. We shlould create a settings screen that will include modules and designed in such a way that we can add other future settings. Thes settings should persist to the database. For the current tak I just want to create the new tabbed interface and the settings page along with supporting database tables."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the vulnerability dashboard application, I need to access different types of security reports through a unified interface. The application should allow me to switch between AWS Inspector reports (currently available) and future report types like SBOM through a tabbed interface. I also need the ability to manage which modules are enabled through a settings screen, with my preferences being remembered across sessions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is loaded with default settings, **When** the user views the main interface, **Then** they see tabs for each enabled module with AWS Inspector module active by default
2. **Given** the user is on the main interface, **When** they click on a different module tab, **Then** the interface switches to display that module's content
3. **Given** the user navigates to the settings screen, **When** they enable or disable a module, **Then** the change is reflected in the tabbed interface immediately
4. **Given** the user has modified module settings, **When** they close and reopen the application, **Then** their module preferences are preserved
5. **Given** the settings screen is open, **When** the user makes changes and saves, **Then** the settings are persisted to the database
6. **Given** only one module is enabled in settings, **When** viewing the main interface, **Then** the tab bar shows only the enabled module

### Edge Cases
- What happens when all modules are disabled in settings? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should at least one module be required to remain active?]
- How does system handle when a user tries to access a disabled module directly?
- What happens if database is unavailable when saving settings?
- How does the system behave for first-time users with no saved preferences?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a tabbed interface showing all enabled modules
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain AWS Inspector reports as the default module (Module 1)
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a settings screen accessible from the main interface
- **FR-004**: Settings screen MUST allow users to enable/disable individual modules
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist all settings changes to the database
- **FR-006**: System MUST load user's saved settings preferences on application start
- **FR-007**: AWS Inspector module MUST be enabled by default for new users
- **FR-008**: All other modules MUST be disabled by default for new users
- **FR-009**: System MUST support adding future modules without breaking existing functionality
- **FR-010**: Settings screen MUST be designed to accommodate future non-module settings
- **FR-011**: Tab interface MUST dynamically update when module settings change
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide visual indication of the currently active tab/module
- **FR-013**: Each module MUST have its own dedicated content area in the interface
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle module switching without losing unsaved work [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What constitutes "unsaved work" in the current application context?]
- **FR-015**: Settings changes MUST take effect immediately without requiring application restart

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Module**: Represents a distinct functional area of the application (e.g., AWS Inspector, SBOM). Has properties like name, enabled status, default state, and display order
- **User Settings**: Stores user preferences including which modules are enabled/disabled, persisted across sessions
- **Module Configuration**: Contains module-specific settings and metadata, relationship to User Settings for enabled state
- **Application Settings**: Future container for non-module related settings, extensible structure to accommodate various setting types
