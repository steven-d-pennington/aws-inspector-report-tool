# Feature Specification: Date Filter for Vulnerabilities Page

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-a-filter`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add a filter to the vulnerabilities page that will be a data input and should be a calendar select and allow user to select a day on the calenday and that will filter on lastObservedAt and will look for anything that is equal to or before the selected date."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a security analyst reviewing vulnerability data, I want to filter vulnerabilities by their last observed date so that I can focus on vulnerabilities that were detected before a specific date and prioritize older findings that may require immediate attention.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the vulnerabilities page, **When** I select a date from the calendar filter, **Then** the vulnerability list shows only vulnerabilities where the lastObservedAt date is equal to or before my selected date
2. **Given** I have selected a date filter, **When** I clear the date selection, **Then** all vulnerabilities are displayed regardless of their lastObservedAt date
3. **Given** I select today's date in the calendar filter, **When** the filter is applied, **Then** all vulnerabilities with lastObservedAt of today or earlier are shown
4. **Given** I select a future date in the calendar filter, **When** the filter is applied, **Then** all vulnerabilities are displayed since no vulnerability can have a lastObservedAt date in the future

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a vulnerability has no lastObservedAt date recorded?
- How does the system handle when the selected date is in the future?
- What occurs when combining the date filter with other existing filters (severity, status, etc.)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a calendar date picker input on the vulnerabilities page
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to select any date from the calendar picker
- **FR-003**: System MUST filter vulnerabilities to show only those with lastObservedAt dates equal to or before the selected date
- **FR-004**: System MUST update the vulnerability list immediately when a date is selected
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a way to clear the date filter and return to showing all vulnerabilities
- **FR-006**: System MUST exclude vulnerabilities with null or missing lastObservedAt dates when date filter is active
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain the date filter when combined with other existing filter criteria
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist the selected date filter across page refreshes and browser sessions using local storage

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Vulnerability**: Contains lastObservedAt timestamp field that represents when the vulnerability was most recently detected by AWS Inspector
- **Date Filter**: User-selected date value used to filter vulnerability records based on their lastObservedAt field
