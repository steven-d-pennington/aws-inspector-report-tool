# Feature Specification: Settings Page with Database Management

**Feature Branch**: `007-settings-page-we`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "settings page. We need a settings page that initially will just include a database menu where the user can clear the database. There should be an option to just clear the database which should essentially reset and clear everything including history, an option to backup should be available as well."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input 
   � Settings page with database management functionality identified
2. Extract key concepts from description 
   � Actors: System administrators, application users
   � Actions: Clear database, backup database, access settings
   � Data: All vulnerability data, reports, historical records, settings
   � Constraints: Data safety, admin access control
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → ✓ Access control: Admin-only access for security and data safety
   → ✓ Confirmation: Multi-step confirmation with text verification
   → ✓ Storage: Local filesystem with download capability
   → ✓ Format: Compressed SQL dump for portability and efficiency
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section 
   � Primary flow: Administrator accessing database management controls
5. Generate Functional Requirements 
   � Each requirement focused on database operations and user safety
6. Identify Key Entities 
   � Settings page, database operations, backup files
7. Run Review Checklist
   → ✓ All clarifications resolved, spec ready for implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a vulnerability dashboard administrator, I need a settings page with database management tools so that I can maintain the system by clearing old data when needed and creating backups to protect against data loss.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am an administrator, **When** I navigate to the settings page, **Then** I should see a database management section with clear and backup options
2. **Given** I want to reset the system, **When** I select the option to clear the database, **Then** the system should remove all vulnerability data, reports, and history while preserving essential system settings
3. **Given** I want to protect my data, **When** I select the backup option, **Then** the system should create a complete backup of the current database
4. **Given** I initiate a destructive operation, **When** I confirm the action, **Then** the system should provide appropriate warnings and require explicit confirmation before proceeding
5. **Given** a backup or clear operation is in progress, **When** I check the status, **Then** I should see progress indicators and be notified when the operation completes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to clear the database while reports are being processed?
- How does the system handle backup operations when disk space is limited?
- What happens if a backup operation is interrupted midway?
- How does the system behave if multiple users try to perform database operations simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a dedicated settings page accessible from the main navigation
- **FR-002**: System MUST include a database management section within the settings page
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to clear all database content including vulnerabilities, reports, and history
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve essential system settings and configuration during database clear operations
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to create complete database backups on demand
- **FR-006**: System MUST require multi-step confirmation including text verification before executing destructive operations like database clearing
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear warnings about the consequences of clearing the database
- **FR-008**: System MUST show progress indicators during long-running operations like backup or clear
- **FR-009**: System MUST notify users when database operations complete successfully or fail
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent concurrent destructive database operations to maintain data integrity
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate administrator privileges before allowing access to database management features
- **FR-012**: System MUST store backup files in local filesystem with download capability for users
- **FR-013**: System MUST create backups in compressed SQL dump format for portability and efficiency

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Database clear operations MUST complete within a reasonable timeframe for typical dataset sizes
- **PR-002**: Backup operations MUST not significantly impact system performance for other users
- **PR-003**: Settings page MUST load within 2 seconds under normal conditions

### Security Requirements
- **SR-001**: System MUST log all database management operations for audit purposes
- **SR-002**: System MUST validate user permissions before displaying destructive operation controls
- **SR-003**: System MUST prevent unauthorized access to database management features

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Settings Page**: Central configuration interface containing database management tools and future configuration options
- **Database Operations**: Clear and backup functions that manage the entire vulnerability database while preserving system integrity
- **Backup Files**: Complete database snapshots created on demand for data protection and recovery purposes
- **Operation Status**: Progress tracking and completion notifications for long-running database operations
