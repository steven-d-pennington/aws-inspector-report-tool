# Feature Specification: Database Migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL

**Feature Branch**: `006-database-refactor-sqlite`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Database refactor. Sqlite is not going to work with large datasets so let's refactor to postgres. I have a local postgres server running and the credentials and information are in @.env So create a new schema on that server."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input 
   � Database scalability issue identified with SQLite
2. Extract key concepts from description 
   � Actors: System administrators, application users
   � Actions: Migrate database schema, preserve data, switch connections
   � Data: All vulnerability data, reports, historical records
   � Constraints: Zero data loss, minimal downtime, preserve functionality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the expected data volume threshold?]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is this migration one-time or gradual rollout?]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the acceptable downtime window?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section 
   � Primary flow: Seamless transition with preserved functionality
5. Generate Functional Requirements 
   � Each requirement focused on data integrity and performance
6. Identify Key Entities 
   � Database schema, connection management, data migration tools
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding migration strategy"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a vulnerability dashboard administrator, I need the system to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite to handle large datasets efficiently, while preserving only essential configuration settings, so that I can manage enterprise-scale vulnerability data without performance limitations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system currently uses SQLite, **When** I upload large vulnerability reports (>1000 findings), **Then** the PostgreSQL system should process them efficiently without timeouts or memory issues
2. **Given** the current system has no persistent settings data, **When** the database migration occurs, **Then** the system should start completely fresh with empty PostgreSQL tables
3. **Given** I'm switching from SQLite to PostgreSQL, **When** the database change happens, **Then** I should start with a clean slate for vulnerability data but retain my configuration preferences
4. **Given** the system now uses PostgreSQL, **When** I perform normal operations (upload, search, export), **Then** the functionality should work identically to the SQLite version but with better performance
5. **Given** multiple users access the system simultaneously, **When** they perform concurrent operations, **Then** the PostgreSQL database should handle the load better than SQLite

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the PostgreSQL server is unavailable during migration?
- How does the system handle concurrent users during the database switch?
- What happens if the migration process is interrupted midway?
- How does the system behave with mixed data states (some in SQLite, some in PostgreSQL)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST create fresh PostgreSQL schema with no data migration (clean slate approach)
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain identical functionality after migrating from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle large datasets (>10,000 vulnerability records) efficiently with PostgreSQL
- **FR-004**: System MUST create a fresh PostgreSQL schema for vulnerability data (clean slate approach)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide improved performance for large dataset operations compared to SQLite
- **FR-006**: System MUST support concurrent user access better than the current SQLite implementation
- **FR-007**: System MUST complete migration with minimal service interruption
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate PostgreSQL schema creation and connection after migration completion
- **FR-009**: System MUST connect to the existing PostgreSQL server using provided credentials from .env
- **FR-010**: System MUST recreate all database tables and constraints in PostgreSQL format

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: System MUST process vulnerability reports 50% faster than SQLite for datasets >1000 records
- **PR-002**: System MUST support at least 10 concurrent users without performance degradation
- **PR-003**: System MUST handle database queries within 2 seconds for typical operations
- **PR-004**: System MUST support databases up to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the target maximum dataset size?] without significant performance impact

### Data Requirements
- **DR-001**: System MUST start with completely fresh PostgreSQL database (no data migration)
- **DR-002**: System MUST create fresh vulnerability tables in PostgreSQL (no historical data migration)
- **DR-003**: System MUST clear any existing uploaded report files (clean slate approach)
- **DR-004**: System MUST recreate all table relationships and foreign key constraints in PostgreSQL
- **DR-005**: System MUST start with empty vulnerability data tables ready for new uploads

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Database Schema**: Complete table structure including indexes, constraints, and relationships that must be recreated in PostgreSQL
- **Clean Database**: Fresh PostgreSQL database with empty tables ready for new data
- **Fresh Vulnerability Tables**: Empty table structure ready to receive new vulnerability data uploads
- **Connection Configuration**: Database connection settings and credentials management for the new PostgreSQL backend using .env configuration
- **Upload Storage**: Clean uploads directory ready for new file uploads (previous files cleared)
