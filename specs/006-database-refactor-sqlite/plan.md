# Implementation Plan: PostgreSQL Migration

**Feature**: Database Migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL
**Branch**: `006-database-refactor-sqlite`
**Status**: Planning Complete - Ready for Implementation
**Date**: 2025-09-18

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Migrate vulnerability dashboard from SQLite to PostgreSQL for improved performance with large datasets
**Approach**: Clean slate migration with fresh PostgreSQL schema (no data preservation)
**Performance Goal**: 50% faster processing for datasets >1000 records
**Timeline**: 3-5 days implementation + validation

## Technical Context

### Current Architecture
- **Database**: SQLite with 8 tables (reports, vulnerabilities, resources, packages, references, vulnerability_history, resource_history, upload_events)
- **Service Layer**: `src/models/database.js` - centralized database operations
- **Performance Issue**: SQLite struggling with large datasets (>1000 vulnerability records)
- **Concurrency**: Limited by SQLite single-writer constraint

### Target Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized schema and indexing
- **Connection**: Pool-based connections for concurrent access
- **Performance**: Connection pooling, prepared statements, bulk operations
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL database `vulnerability_reports` on localhost:5432
- **Credentials**: User `report_gen` with password `StarDust`

### Migration Strategy
**Selective Migration Approach**:
- **Settings Data Migration**: Preserve all 9 configuration records from settings table
- **Vulnerability Data**: Fresh start (no migration of vulnerability/report data)
- **Database Creation**: PostgreSQL database `vulnerability_reports` created successfully
- **Performance Optimizations**: Fresh PostgreSQL schema with enhanced indexing
- **Service Interface**: Maintain identical interface for zero application code changes

### Technology Alignment âœ…
**Current Stack**: Node.js (JavaScript ES6+) + Express.js, EJS, SQLite3, vanilla JavaScript
**Migration Impact**: Add PostgreSQL support while maintaining all existing technologies
**New Dependencies**: `pg` library for PostgreSQL connectivity

## Phase Execution Summary

### Phase 0: Research (COMPLETED âœ…)
**Deliverable**: `research.md`
**Outcome**: Comprehensive analysis of PostgreSQL migration patterns

**Key Research Findings**:
- PostgreSQL connection pooling strategy with `pg` library
- SQLite to PostgreSQL data type mapping and schema conversion
- Performance optimization through indexing and bulk operations
- Clean slate migration approach validated as optimal
- Service layer abstraction allows drop-in replacement

**Dependencies Identified**:
- `pg` library for PostgreSQL connectivity
- Environment configuration for connection pooling
- Schema creation scripts with proper constraints and indexes

### Phase 1: Design (COMPLETED âœ…)
**Deliverables**: `data-model.md`, `contracts.md`, `quickstart.md`
**Outcome**: Complete technical design ready for implementation

**Data Model Design (`data-model.md`)**:
- Complete PostgreSQL schema for 8 tables with optimized data types
- Performance-focused indexing strategy for common query patterns
- Enhanced constraints and validation beyond SQLite capabilities
- JSONB fields for flexible metadata storage

**API Contracts (`contracts.md`)**:
- Service interface maintaining exact compatibility with existing code
- PostgreSQL-specific optimizations (connection pooling, bulk operations)
- Comprehensive error handling and transaction management
- Performance monitoring and health check capabilities

**Validation Guide (`quickstart.md`)**:
- 8 comprehensive test scenarios covering all requirements
- Performance benchmarking and load testing procedures
- Data integrity validation and constraint testing
- Migration success criteria and sign-off procedures

### Phase 2: Task Generation (READY ðŸš€)
**Approach**: Structured task generation based on completed design work
**Strategy**: Incremental implementation with validation at each step

## Phase 2 Implementation Strategy

### Task Generation Approach

**Parallel Development Tracks**:
1. **Database Infrastructure**: Schema creation, connection management
2. **Service Migration**: Database service layer conversion
3. **Validation & Testing**: Automated testing and performance validation
4. **Documentation & Deployment**: Integration guides and deployment procedures

**Task Categorization**:
- **Foundation Tasks**: Core infrastructure that other tasks depend on
- **Implementation Tasks**: Main feature development work
- **Validation Tasks**: Testing and quality assurance
- **Integration Tasks**: System integration and deployment

### Dependency Management

**Critical Path Dependencies**:
```
