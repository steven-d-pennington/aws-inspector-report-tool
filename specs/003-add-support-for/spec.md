# Feature Specification: Add CSV Format Support for AWS Inspector Reports

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-support-for`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add support for CSV format AWS Inspector reports in addition to the existing JSON format. The application should automatically detect file type (.json vs .csv) during upload and parse CSV files into the same internal data structure, requiring a CSV parser service and minor upload handler modifications."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’  Feature description parsed: Dual format support for AWS Inspector reports
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’  Actors: Users uploading reports; Actions: Upload, parse, detect format; Data: AWS Inspector reports in JSON/CSV; Constraints: Same internal structure
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’  No major ambiguities identified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’  Clear user flow: Upload either format, system processes correctly
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’  Requirements are testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’  File uploads, report data, vulnerability records
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’  No implementation details, focused on user needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a security analyst, I want to upload AWS Inspector vulnerability reports in either JSON or CSV format so that I can use the format that is most convenient for my workflow without being restricted to a single export type from AWS Inspector.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a JSON AWS Inspector report, **When** they upload it through the application, **Then** the report is processed successfully and vulnerabilities are displayed in the dashboard
2. **Given** a user has a CSV AWS Inspector report, **When** they upload it through the application, **Then** the report is processed successfully and vulnerabilities are displayed in the dashboard with the same data fields as JSON uploads
3. **Given** a user uploads a file with an unsupported format, **When** the system processes the upload, **Then** an error message clearly indicates which formats are supported
4. **Given** a user uploads a CSV file with malformed data, **When** the system processes the upload, **Then** specific error messages indicate which rows or fields have issues

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a CSV file has missing required columns?
- How does the system handle CSV files with extra columns not present in JSON format?
- What occurs when file extension doesn't match actual file content (e.g., .csv file containing JSON)?
- How are empty CSV cells handled compared to null values in JSON?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept both JSON and CSV file formats for AWS Inspector report uploads
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically detect file format based on file extension (.json or .csv)
- **FR-003**: System MUST parse CSV files and extract the same vulnerability data fields that are currently extracted from JSON files
- **FR-004**: System MUST display uploaded vulnerabilities identically regardless of whether they originated from JSON or CSV format
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear error messages when unsupported file formats are uploaded
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that CSV files contain all required columns before processing
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle multiple packages listed in a single CSV row (comma-separated values)
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve all existing functionality for JSON file uploads without any regression
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain the same upload file size limits for both JSON and CSV formats
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to upload CSV files through the same interface currently used for JSON files

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **File Upload**: Represents an uploaded AWS Inspector report file, containing format type (JSON/CSV), original filename, file size, and processing status
- **Vulnerability Report**: The parsed vulnerability data extracted from either JSON or CSV format, containing finding details, resource information, package details, and reference URLs
- **Supported Format**: Defines valid file formats and their associated parsing requirements, including required columns for CSV and expected JSON structure
