# Feature Specification: Vulnerability History Tracking and Fixed Status Reporting

**Feature Branch**: `002-history-collection-i`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "History collection. I want the ability to see and track vulnerabilities over time. I want to create a history table that collects relevent information for tracking historical reports. When I upload a new report the tool should populate the history table with relevent data and then completely clear the tables and then parse and ingest the newly uploaded file. Then we should create a new report page that can show reports based on what has been \"fixed\" as decided by comparing existing records in the history table and marking records that are no longer present in the newly uploaded file."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a security analyst managing AWS Inspector vulnerability reports over time, I want to track the lifecycle of vulnerabilities across multiple report uploads so that I can identify which vulnerabilities have been fixed, which persist, and which are newly discovered, enabling me to measure remediation progress and maintain historical context for security posture analysis.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have previously uploaded vulnerability reports, **When** I upload a new report, **Then** the system saves relevant data from current vulnerabilities to a history table before replacing current data with the new report
2. **Given** I have uploaded multiple reports over time, **When** I access the fixed vulnerabilities report page, **Then** I can see vulnerabilities that existed in previous reports but are no longer present in the current report
3. **Given** vulnerabilities exist in the history table, **When** a new report is uploaded that contains some of the same vulnerabilities, **Then** those vulnerabilities are not marked as "fixed" in the fixed vulnerabilities report
4. **Given** I want to track vulnerability trends, **When** I view the fixed vulnerabilities report, **Then** I can see when each vulnerability was last observed and when it was determined to be fixed
5. **Given** I upload a new report, **When** the system processes the upload, **Then** all current vulnerability tables are completely cleared before the new data is ingested

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the same vulnerability appears with different details (e.g., different severity) across reports?
- How does the system handle the first report upload when no history exists?
- What occurs if the upload process fails after history data is saved but before new data is fully ingested?
- How are vulnerabilities identified as "the same" across different reports for comparison purposes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST create and maintain a history table that stores relevant vulnerability information from previous reports
- **FR-002**: System MUST populate the history table with current vulnerability data before processing each new report upload
- **FR-003**: System MUST completely clear all current vulnerability tables after saving data to history and before ingesting new report data
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a new report page that displays vulnerabilities marked as "fixed"
- **FR-005**: System MUST determine "fixed" status by comparing history table records with current vulnerabilities and identifying those no longer present
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific vulnerability attributes are "relevant" for history tracking - all fields, subset, or summary data?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle vulnerability identification for comparison purposes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how are vulnerabilities matched between history and current data - by CVE ID, finding ARN, combination of fields?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST timestamp history records [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should timestamp indicate when vulnerability was first observed, last observed, or when it was archived to history?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain data integrity during the upload process [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what should happen if the process fails partway through - rollback capability needed?]
- **FR-010**: Fixed vulnerabilities report MUST display [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific information should be shown - vulnerability details, fix date, how long it was active?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **History Record**: Represents a vulnerability's state at a specific point in time, containing relevant vulnerability information and temporal metadata for tracking purposes
- **Fixed Vulnerability**: Represents a vulnerability that existed in previous reports but is no longer present in the current report, derived from comparing history records with current data
- **Report Upload Event**: Represents the process of uploading a new vulnerability report, triggering history preservation, data clearing, and new data ingestion
- **Vulnerability Comparison**: Logic for determining if vulnerabilities across different time periods represent the same security issue for tracking fix status
