# Feature Specification: Dockerize Application with PostgreSQL

**Feature Branch**: `008-dockerize-this-app`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Dockerize this app. I would like this app to run in a docker container with postgres running either in the container or as part of a docker compose set up. Also update the documentation in README.md to reflect the new changes"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Identified: containerization, PostgreSQL database, documentation update
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: developers, system administrators, deployment operators
   ’ Actions: containerize application, configure database, update documentation
   ’ Data: application code, database configuration, deployment settings
   ’ Constraints: must support PostgreSQL, must update README
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Marked development vs production configurations
   ’ Marked data persistence requirements
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Created deployment and development scenarios
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable
   ’ Marked ambiguous requirements for clarity
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Application container, database container, configuration
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding environment configurations"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or system administrator, I want to run the AWS Inspector Report Tool application in containers so that I can ensure consistent deployment across different environments, simplify setup, and isolate dependencies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh development environment with Docker installed, **When** a developer runs the containerized application for the first time, **Then** the application and database should start successfully without manual configuration
2. **Given** the application is running in containers, **When** the application container restarts, **Then** all database data should persist and remain accessible
3. **Given** a user wants to deploy the application, **When** they follow the README instructions, **Then** they should be able to get the application running in containers within 5 minutes
4. **Given** the application is containerized, **When** a developer makes code changes, **Then** they should be able to see changes reflected [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should containers support hot-reload for development?]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when PostgreSQL container fails to start?
- How does system handle database connection loss?
- What happens when containers run out of resources?
- How are application logs accessed when running in containers?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST run the application in a Docker container with all necessary dependencies
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide PostgreSQL database either within the same container or as a separate container service
- **FR-003**: Database data MUST persist across container restarts and recreations
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow configuration of database connection parameters [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which parameters should be configurable - host, port, credentials, database name?]
- **FR-005**: README documentation MUST include clear instructions for running the containerized application
- **FR-006**: System MUST expose the application on [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which port should the application be accessible on?]
- **FR-007**: Containers MUST start in the correct order with proper health checks to ensure database is ready before application connects
- **FR-008**: System MUST support running in both development and [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should it support production configuration as well?]
- **FR-009**: Container logs MUST be accessible for debugging and monitoring purposes
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle graceful shutdown of application and database containers
- **FR-011**: README MUST include instructions for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should it include instructions for building custom images, using pre-built images, or both?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST support environment-specific configuration [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: through environment variables, config files, or both?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Application Container**: The containerized AWS Inspector Report Tool application with all runtime dependencies
- **Database Container**: PostgreSQL database container with persistent storage
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific settings for database connection, application ports, and other runtime parameters
- **Volume/Storage**: Persistent storage mechanism for database data that survives container lifecycle
