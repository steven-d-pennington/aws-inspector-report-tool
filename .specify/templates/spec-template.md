# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   - If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   - Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   - Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   - If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   - Each requirement must be testable
   - Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   - If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   - If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Quick Guidelines
- Focus on what security teams and analysts must accomplish and why the feature matters.
- Call out constitution-driven constraints (security, data integrity, observability) that shape the scope.
- Keep implementation details out of the spec; technology decisions belong in the plan.
- Highlight ambiguities or gaps that could weaken risk reporting or expose sensitive data.
- Write for business and security stakeholders using measurable outcomes.

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow analysts to upload AWS Inspector JSON reports via the dashboard.
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist parsed findings to PostgreSQL with the original payload metadata.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to filter findings by severity, status, resource, fix availability, and full-text search.
- **FR-004**: System MUST export selected findings to PDF and Markdown with consistent formatting.
- **FR-005**: System MUST log ingestion, export, and sanitisation outcomes for observability dashboards.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST enforce [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication or authorisation approach not specified].
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain uploaded reports for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period or deletion policy not specified].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]
